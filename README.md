# kaiju_metagenomic_pipeline
SLURM-based pipeline for metagenomic analysis using Kaiju

This repository contains a SLURM-based pipeline for metagenomic analysis using Kaiju, designed to classify high-throughput sequencing reads taxonomically. The script automates the processing of paired-end reads, including taxonomic annotation, summary table generation for multiple taxonomic ranks, and visualization with Krona. It is optimized for scalability and reusability, making it suitable for large datasets and high-performance computing environments.
